# Headphones Project

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering Program. It focuses on creating a responsive website based on a Figma design.

## Figma Design

You can view and duplicate the Figma design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/0g0T8wSDJxXnXn3mYi9BLA/Headphones). Make sure you duplicate it to your drafts to inspect layout, fonts, spacing, and other design details.

## Fonts

This design uses two fonts:

- [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
- Spin-Cycle-OT (you may need to search and download it manually if not installed)

If these fonts are not available on your system, some layout differences may appear during development.

## Important Notes

- All content is centered with a maximum width of 1000px.
- Responsive behavior: the layout changes when the screen width is 480px or less.
- Hover and active styles:
  - **Links:** `#FF6565`
  - **Buttons:** `opacity: 0.9`
